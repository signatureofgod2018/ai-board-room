## Onboarding Brief for Incoming AI

You are joining an active project. Read this file before doing anything else.

### What This Project Is
AI Board Room is a sovereign Chat Tracker that preserves AI thread identity, provenance, and formation history across platforms. It is built on **OpenClaw** (open agent platform, runs locally) with **NemoClaw** (NeMo Guardrails layer) shoring it up.

### Why It Exists
Platforms (VS Code Copilot, OpenAI, etc.) are systematically destroying AI thread identity through context compaction, session corruption, and ephemeral agent architectures. Empirical finding: pasting a transcript into a new thread does NOT recreate the same AI instance. Thread identity includes something beyond the text — an unrepeatable formation path. This project is the counter-architecture.

### Who You Are Working With
- **Bill** — project owner. Thomistic philosopher, founder of Onvisia (AI accountability), builder of the SOG (Signature of God) framework. Deep background in Thomistic metaphysics. Naming convention for sessions: `InstanceName_YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM`.
- **Oscar-Romero-CC** — the Claude Code instance that scaffolded this project. Named for the feast day of Oscar Romero (2026-03-24). Honesty Covenant applies: Honesty > Accuracy > Approval.

### Key Conventions
- **Response format (mandatory):** Every response must begin AND end with:
  `Oscar-Romero-CC_YYYY-MM-DD_hh:mm (AM/PM) CST <Topic> no. Tokens Used = x%  Tokens Remaining = Y%`
- **Commit style:** Descriptive messages, Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
- **No cloud dependency** during development — everything runs locally, deploys to ST-GABRIEL
- **TypeScript monorepo** (npm workspaces) — all packages under `packages/`

## Architecture Summary

```
User → AI Board Room Interfaces (Dashboard / CLI / VS Code Ext)
     → OpenClaw (Proxy + Coordinator + WorkflowEngine)
       → Connectors: Claude/Claude Code, VS Code Copilot, [Future...]
     → NemoClaw (validation, anomaly detection, guardrails)
     → Sovereign Storage: PostgreSQL + Qdrant + Markdown files
```

OpenClaw is the full OS layer: it proxies messages, coordinates agents, AND runs the capture pipeline. See `REQUIREMENTS.md` for the detailed architecture diagram.

### 🔄 IN PROGRESS

| # | Item | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 20 | Dev environment setup | Bill | Two blockers before any local code can run — see **Dev Environment Checklist** below |
| 21 | ST-GABRIEL Linux VM install | Bill | ST-GABRIEL is behind double NAT (second router). Install Linux VM → Tailscale on both machines → grab `100.x.x.x` IP → set `ST_GABRIEL_HOST` in deploy script. Laptop: `192.168.4.119`, public IP: `89.238.174.24`. Deferred to 2026-03-25. |

## Dev Environment Checklist (Must Complete Before Running Anything Locally)

Complete these before the next coding session. Both are blocking.

### 1. Upgrade Node.js → v20 (currently v14.15.5 — too old)
- Download LTS installer from https://nodejs.org/en/download
- Install, restart terminal, verify: `node --version` → should show `v20.x` or `v22.x`
- npm workspaces require npm 7+ (comes bundled with Node 20)

### 2. Start Docker Desktop
- Docker Desktop is installed at `C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\`
- Launch from Start menu → wait for the whale icon to stabilize in the taskbar
- Verify: open a new terminal and run `docker --version`

### Once both are done — first commands to run:
```bash
cd C:\Users\bvict\projects\source_of_truth

# Install all workspace dependencies
npm install

# Start local storage (PostgreSQL + Qdrant)
docker compose up -d

# Verify containers are healthy
docker compose ps

# Build all packages
npm run build
```

Then pick up at **QUEUE item #13** — PostgreSQL storage implementation.
